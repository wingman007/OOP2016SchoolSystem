SchoolSystem is a free to use online software which is meant to help storing the information that a school use every day. However the project is still in infancy so many of the features are still nor released. The data is being saved in protected data base. 
There would be limited accounts created by admin supposed to be used only by the teachers. Being logged as a teacher you would be able to add new subjects and student. The teacher users would edit or delete these fields. On the other hand the grades and teachers can be edited only by the admin. All other people: students, parents, ect. , will not be allowed to register in the system. However, they would be able to view the already added data so they can look for the information they want to check. there would also be section with the assesstments of the students where the teachers can add and edit them and the un logged users would spectate them. However, this feature is not released yet. 
The startup file is located in the main folder of the application. It is called ScoolSystem. You can start the program by opening that file. When the loading is complete the application could run by pressing “Ctrl + F5”. Right after the combination is pressed a new page in the browser would appear. Then the starting page would appear. However most of the ideas of the project are not featured.
